# gdluxx-browser

gdluxx-browser is a companion browser extension for
[gdluxx](https://github.com/gdluxx/gdluxx)

[See some screenshots](#screenshots)

## What's it about?

gdluxx exposes an API endpoint. This extension is simply a small popup that
allows you to enter the URL for gdluxx along with an API key. You can then send
the active tab URL to gdluxx with a button click. gdluxx then executes
_gallery-dl_ against the received URL.

## Why?

I've been using _gallery-dl_ for a long time now, it's a great program. And
while I've come up with processes to make using _gallery-dl_ simpler (rather
than executing it against one URL at a time in the terminal), this will
eliminate the need to leave the browser. I'm guessing I'll be needing more
storage space very soon.
