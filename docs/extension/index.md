# Browser Extension

The gdluxx browser extension works to bring gallery-dl right into your browser. Send URLs
directly to your gdluxx server without ever leaving your browser.

## What It Does

Instead of copying URLs and switching back to gdluxx, you can:

- **Send the current tab URL** directly to gdluxx
- **Right-click an image** and send just that image
- **Use a keyboard shortcut**
- **Send multiple URLs at once**
- **Set custom download directories**

It's built to streamline the process.

## Browser Support

The extension works on:

- **Chrome/Chromium** (and should work on any Chrome-based browsers like Brave, Edge, Opera)
- **Firefox** (and should work on any Firefox-based browsers like Floorp, Librewolf, Waterfox)

Both are officially published to their respective stores.
