# First Run Setup

After installing, you need to create the first admin account.

### 1. Open the Web UI

Navigate to `http://<your-server-ip>:7755` or `https://my-cool-domain.com` if
using a reverse proxy. Since this is your first time, you'll be automatically
redirected to the setup page.

### 2. Create Admin User

Fill in the form with your desired username, email, and password; click **Create
Account**. This will be the only user account, there's currently no multi-user
support.

That's it. You're in. Now you can start using the application.
